Coronavirous Information iOS App

Learn about coronavirus safety and readiness today with Coronavirus Info. You will not only find information on how the disease spreads, symptoms, treatment, prevention, and more on this app, you can also see the latest news on COVID-19, updates on cases in every state, maps for data tracking. With data tracking, you can find out about the current situation of the infection worldwide. For our US users, you can find state-level or even county-level statistics on COVID-19. The number of confirmed cases and number of deaths for every country will be displayed on an interactive map. 

Coronavirus Info also includes a mini game to keep its users entertained while staying at home. The game is like the classic whac-a-mole, but it is optimized for touch control. Player gains a point with every successful hit on the virus. If the player does not strike the virus within a certain time, it will disappear into thin air with no score. Although gameplay starts out slow, viruses will pop out more and more frequently with each virus showing less time for the player to hit and with more viruses appearing at the same time. In addition, the player will have a small chance to gain vaccine research points when hitting the virus. The game will end when the vaccine research is 100% completed.
